-The api uses the **Flask** library.
    $ pip install Flask
-To be able to run api.py it is required to export the FLASK_APP env variable. This is platform specific so see the flask quickstart for the relevant commandline command if needed. https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/ (note: hello.py should be replaced by api.py)
-To run api.py
    flask run --port 8888
-The api should now be accepting POST requests
